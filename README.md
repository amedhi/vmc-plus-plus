A C++ program for Variational Monte Carlo simulation of quantum lattice models. 
The core code is model and lattice geometry independent. Hence it can be 
adapted to work with arbitrary lattice geometry and Hamiltonian.
The code is designed to make it easy to add a new model or a lattice, 
a new physical observable for measurement or a new input parameter for 
the program.
